Code used in stuttering taxometrics study

Study Aim: test whether stuttering in adults and children is dimensional (i.e. a "spectrum") or categorical. This project aims to collaborate with researchers who have collected datasets of stuttering-related metrics, such as stuttering frequency and dysfluency durations, from a large enough population of stutterers and non-stutterers (n=300 subjects) to use taxometric procedures. Techniques will be employed from the field of taxometrics, which is a suite of tools traditionally employed in psychiatry for testing whether pathology constructs (in this case stuttering) describe disrete categories or instead a continuum of severity levels
