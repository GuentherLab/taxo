003
All transcripts have corresponding audio files.
There's an unmatched audio file: 9.mp3. According to its original filename (YA_003_5_6_7_8_00004), it is possibly an extension of session 7 (00003), but 7.cha doesn't reflect this (it ends where 7.mp3 ends).
There are two dummy transcripts.

All transcripts and audio files correspond.
There's one dummy transcript.

All transcripts and audio files correspond.
There are two dummy transcripts.

030
All transcripts have corresponding audio files.
2.cha is a dummy transcript. Apparently 2.mp3 hasn't been transcribed. From what I can tell by sampling audio from 2.mp3, it is indeed a separate session and not a second half to 1.mp3.

059
Most transcripts and audio files correspond.
There are two unmatched transcripts, 2.cha and 5.cha, as well as two unmatched audio files which were originally 3.mp3 and 6.mp3.
Obviously, it would make sense if these in fact corresponded, but I haven't been able to pinpoint any material in either of those audio files matching material in those transcripts.
It is certainly the same child speaking, however.

060
All transcripts have corresponding audio files.
There's an unmatched audio file which was originally 3.mp3. It is possibly an extension of session 1_5, but I haven't pinpointed any matching material in that transcript.
There are three dummy transcripts.

067
Transcripts 1, 2, 3, & 5 have corresponding audio files.
However, I haven't ascertained which audio file 7.cha corresponds to.
There are many unmatched audio files: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, as well as the files which were originally 3.mp3 and 5.mp3. I can't pinpoint matching material in any of these.
There are six dummy transcripts.

076
Transcripts up to 4.cha have corresponding audio files.
There are no audio files from 5.cha up.

090
All transcripts and audio files correspond.

110
All transcripts and audio files correspond except that 6.mp3 is unaccounted for.

117
Transcripts from 3.cha on have corresponding audio files.
Audio files for earlier sessions are unaccounted for.
